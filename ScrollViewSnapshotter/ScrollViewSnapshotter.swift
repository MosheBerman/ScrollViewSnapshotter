         *  Step 1: The first thing we need is the default origin and size of our pages.
         *          Since bounds always start at (0, 0) and the scroll view's bounds give us
         *          the correct size for the visible area, we can just use that.
         *
         *          In the United States, a standard printed page is 8.5 inches by 11 inches,
         *          but when generating a PDF it's simpler to keep the page size matching the
         *          visible area of the scroll view. We can let our printer software (such
         *          as the Preview app on OS X or the Printer app on iOS) do the scaling.
         *
         *          If we wanted to scale ourselves, we could multiply each of those
         *          numbers by 72, to get the number of points for each dimension.
         *          We would have to change how we generated the the pages below, so
         *          for simplicity, we're going to stick to one page per screenful of content.

         *          of each page, in either direction.

                     *          system which has the y coordinate decreasing as we go from top to bottom.
